# Flying Battery Zone Transition Music
This mod adds music to the Transition between Mushroom Hill Zone and Flying Battery Zone! Alternatively, it adds music to the Carnival Night Zone Transition to Flying Battery Zone if Useott's/Legobouwer's Original Zone Order is active.

This mod does not require Either Original Zone Order Mods.

For Modders, there's a function in the `main.lemon` that allows you to put modded sound keys over the Transition Music, so go nuts with that I guess.
